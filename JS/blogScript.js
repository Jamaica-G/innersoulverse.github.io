    title:"Singles Private Dining 02 Mar 2024 - A party of six ",
    text: "The private dining experience was supposed to be a one-to-one rotation session. The first week started very well with four sign-ups, and we were optimistic that we could conclude the registration sooner than expected. However, as subsequent weeks passed, only one person registered for the next four weeks, and another joined on the day of the event. In order not to continue the event, we changed the setup into a group gathering, seating the six attendees together. Surprisingly, this adjustment led to unforeseen positive outcomes. The group's interaction was fantastic, and even extended their stay by about an hour, aided by the presence of sake. We expressed gratitude to the attendees for allowing us to modify the dining arrangement, realizing that a table for six might indeed offer a more enjoyable dining experience.",

    title:"Lazy Sunday KTV 18 Feb 2024 - A lesson on over optimism" ,
    text: "The concept of Lazy Sunday KTV emerged for me personally due to the tendency of Sundays being unproductive and spent preparing for the upcoming workweek. I thought, why not turn it into a day for people to come together and enjoy a karaoke session? The idea was well-received, and we quickly reached our self-imposed limit of 10 attendees within three weeks. Excitement built up as we anticipated a day filled with great singing and socializing. As the day approached, we prepared the venue to accommodate the expected 10 participants, even though we anticipated 2-3 no-shows. However, when the event kicked off at 4 pm, we were met with a surprise â€” only four attendees showed up by 4:30 pm. It was disheartening to see our seemingly popular event turn out to be a bit of a letdown. Despite this, we want to express our gratitude to those who attended for their understanding. They even lightened the mood by joking about enjoying extra opportunities to sing more songs due to the lower turnout.",

    title:"Ice-Dream 29 Oct 2023 - It almost did not happend",
    text: "When initially organizing this event, we searched for workshops willing to collaborate at a reasonable cost. Unfortunately, most options demanded a minimum of $65 per attendee with a requirement of at least 10 participants. After a few days, a workshop reached out to us, assuring affordability and support for our event. However, over the subsequent weeks, the workshop owner became unresponsive to our inquiries. When she did reply, she seemed unfamiliar with our event details, that is a big red flag. But we didn't want to cancel this event, and disappoint the attendees who trusted us and registered, we reluctantly made one final search for workshops online, with the thought that it was going to fail anyway. Just when it seemed to be the case, Ice Cream Chefs, Tom, called.  We explained our predicament, and he generously stepped in to help. We were truly grateful and moved by the presence of reliable vendors like him. Another life lesson in business of not giving up",

    title:"Single Wolf Buffet 23 Oct 2023",
    text:" We held high expectations for the buffet event, when you think that food is in our culture. Yorimichi collaborated with us to craft a special menu exclusively for our event, and the pricing was set at a very reasonable level. In an effort to enhance the event's attractiveness and bypass Eventbrite fees, we opted for free registration, with attendees expected to pay only through PayNow once we reach the target attendance. Although we successfully achieved the desired attendance numbers, only half of the attendees responded to our request for payment. In conclusion we need to reconsider our approach for future events. For now, we will continue with payment-first method through the platform to ensure the success of the event.",

    text:"A big relief when the event came to a conclusion, and we were glad we made it work.  First of all we were not sure if we could host the event as we had imbalance gender ratio. Luckily, we managed to pull through in the final week, gathering two more male participants. And on the day of the event, we were a tad nervy about the kitchen's ability to cater to the vegan and allium-free dietary needs. And we were appreciative that the kitchen had paid attention to the requirements. Though the food according to feedback were fairly ok, we were applauded for our efforts. Looking forward to hosting more vegan-inclusive events in the future. A big thank you to the ground staffs and participants",

  title:"Dining In the Dark 13 Aug 2023",
  text: "We recently hosted our first dining in the dark event since the onset of the pandemic. Our team was on-site at 3:30 PM to set up the venue. However, the setup process took a bit more time than anticipated, primarily because of the curtain installation. The challenge was securing the curtains in hard-to-reach places and ensuring no light leaks. Fortunately, we managed to complete this task just before 6:00 PM. Additionally, there were some issues with setting up the IR camera due to a change in devices. This caused a bit of panic as we received an early call from a participant who arrived before we were fully prepared. Despite this, our team rallied and ensured a smooth event eventually. The event itself ran a bit longer than planned, mainly because of the extra effort put into custom food preparation. Despite the extended duration, we received positive feedback from the participants. They found the experience intriguing, and the food was as fantastic as ever.",

    text: "With the event just two weeks away, we were back for our second mock setup, feeling confident we'd have everything ready for the dry run by 5 pm. However, reality had other plans. Setting up took us an entire hour, and the purchased cloth failed to block out the light, leading to some last-minute curtain arrangements. The entrance pipe works were wonky, demanding additional reinforcements. To our dismay, the speakers couldn't be controlled by the phone volume. As the clock struck 7 pm, we were still figuring out the movement and guidance for participants.Well, hope everything works out !!!",
